# Stats Sections

Stats sections display impressive numbers that build credibility and trust. Whether it's customer counts, success rates, or years in business, numbers provide concrete proof of your value. This guide shows you how to create compelling stats sections that convince visitors you're the right choice.

## What Are Stats Sections?

Stats sections highlight important numbers about your business in a visually appealing way. They help visitors understand:
- **Scale of your success** (customers served, projects completed)
- **Quality of your results** (success rates, satisfaction scores)
- **Experience and stability** (years in business, team size)
- **Social proof** (awards won, media mentions)

Think of stats sections as your "proof of concept" - concrete evidence that you deliver results.

### When to Use Stats Sections

**Perfect for**:
- **Homepage credibility** - Build trust with impressive numbers
- **About page validation** - Show company growth and stability  
- **Service page proof** - Demonstrate track record and results
- **Landing page conversion** - Social proof to encourage action
- **Case study summary** - Highlight key results and outcomes

**Best placement**: After hero sections and before detailed content, as supporting evidence.
