# Steps Sections

Steps sections guide visitors through processes, procedures, or sequences in a clear, easy-to-follow format. They're perfect for explaining "how it works," onboarding procedures, or any multi-step process. This guide shows you how to create effective steps sections that reduce confusion and increase confidence.

## What Are Steps Sections?

Steps sections break down complex processes into digestible, numbered stages that help visitors:
- **Understand procedures** clearly and completely
- **Reduce anxiety** about complex processes
- **Build confidence** by showing clear path forward
- **Visualize the journey** from start to finish

Think of steps sections as your instruction manual - they should make complex things feel simple and achievable.

### When to Use Steps Sections

**Perfect for**:
- **"How it works" pages** - Explain your service or product process
- **Onboarding flows** - Guide new customers through getting started
- **Service pages** - Show your methodology or approach
- **Landing pages** - Demonstrate ease of use or implementation
- **Support pages** - Provide step-by-step instructions

**Best placement**: After value proposition but before testimonials or pricing, showing how easy it is to get results.
