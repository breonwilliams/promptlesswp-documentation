# Hero Sections

Hero sections are the big, attention-grabbing banners that appear at the top of your pages. They're the first thing visitors see, so they need to make a powerful impression. This guide shows you how to create compelling hero sections that convert visitors into customers.

## What Are Hero Sections?

Hero sections are large, prominent sections typically placed at the top of pages that:
- **Grab attention immediately** with bold headlines
- **Communicate your main message** clearly and quickly
- **Encourage action** with prominent buttons
- **Set the tone** for the entire page

Think of hero sections as your "elevator pitch" - you have just seconds to convince visitors to stay and learn more.

### When to Use Hero Sections

**Perfect for**:
- **Homepage headers** - Your main company message
- **Landing pages** - Product or service promotions
- **About pages** - Company introduction
- **Product pages** - Main product benefits
- **Service pages** - Primary service overview

**Best placement**: Always at the top of pages, as the first section visitors see.

## Writing Effective Hero Content

### Headline Best Practices

**Focus on Benefits, Not Features**
- ❌ "Advanced CRM Software with 50+ Features"
- ✅ "Close 3x More Deals with Less Work"

**Use Numbers When Possible**
- ❌ "Save Time on Marketing"
- ✅ "Cut Marketing Time in Half"

**Create Urgency or Curiosity**
- ❌ "Our New Product"
- ✅ "The Tool Everyone's Talking About"

**Keep It Conversational**
- ❌ "Sophisticated Solutions for Complex Business Challenges"
- ✅ "Finally, Software That Actually Makes Sense"

### Supporting Content Guidelines

**Expand on the Promise**
- Explain HOW you deliver the benefit
- Address the biggest objection or concern
- Include social proof or credibility markers

**Use Clear, Simple Language**
- Avoid jargon and technical terms
- Write like you're talking to a friend
- Use active voice ("We help you grow" not "Growth is achieved")

**Include Proof Points**
- Customer numbers or results
- Time in business or experience
- Awards or recognition
- Guarantees or promises

### Button Text That Converts

**Action-Oriented Verbs**
- "Get", "Start", "Download", "Try", "Join"
- Avoid passive words like "Submit" or "Click"

**Create Value Clarity**
- "Get Your Free Quote" (not just "Get Quote")
- "Start Your 30-Day Trial" (not just "Start Trial")
- "Download the Complete Guide" (not just "Download")

**Remove Friction Language**
- ❌ "Request Information" (sounds like sales pitch)
- ✅ "Get Instant Access" (sounds immediate and valuable)

## Technical Considerations

### Image Optimization

**Recommended Dimensions**:
- **Minimum width**: 1200px for desktop displays
- **Aspect ratio**: 16:9 or 4:3 work well
- **File size**: Under 500KB for fast loading

**File Formats**:
- **JPG**: Best for photos, smaller file sizes
- **PNG**: Best for graphics with transparency
- **WebP**: Best compression, modern browsers only

**Optimization Tips**:
- Use image compression tools before uploading
- Choose images that support your message
- Ensure images look good when cropped for mobile

### Video Considerations

**Platform Support**:
- **YouTube**: Most reliable, good loading performance
- **Vimeo**: Professional appearance, fewer ads
- **Direct uploads**: Largest file sizes, hosting bandwidth usage

**Video Best Practices**:
- **Length**: Keep under 2 minutes for hero sections
- **Auto-play**: Enable with mute for best user experience
- **Mobile**: Ensure video works well on small screens
- **Fallback**: Provide thumbnail image for slow connections

### Performance Impact

**Loading Speed Factors**:
- **Image size**: Larger images slow down page loading
- **Video files**: Can significantly impact load times
- **Custom fonts**: May delay text rendering

**Optimization Strategies**:
- **Compress images** before uploading
- **Use modern formats** (WebP, MP4)
- **Consider lazy loading** for below-the-fold content
- **Monitor page speed** with testing tools

## Common Hero Section Mistakes

### Content Mistakes

**Vague Headlines**
- ❌ "Welcome to Our Company"
- ❌ "Quality Service Since 1995"
- ❌ "Your Partner in Success"

**Too Much Text**
- Don't write paragraphs in hero sections
- Visitors scan, they don't read everything
- Save details for later sections

**Weak Calls-to-Action**
- ❌ "Learn More" (learn what?)
- ❌ "Click Here" (why should I?)
- ❌ "Submit" (submit what?)

### Design Mistakes

**Poor Image Choices**
- Generic stock photos that don't relate to content
- Low-resolution or pixelated images
- Images that don't support the message

**Too Many Buttons**
- More than 2 buttons creates decision paralysis
- Competing calls-to-action confuse visitors
- One primary action is usually best

**Inconsistent Styling**
- Colors that don't match the rest of the site
- Fonts that clash with brand guidelines
- Layout that doesn't work on mobile

## Testing and Optimization

### A/B Testing Ideas

**Headlines**:
- Benefit-focused vs feature-focused
- Question format vs statement format
- Short vs longer headlines

**Button Text**:
- "Free" vs "Start Now" vs specific benefit
- First-person ("Get My") vs second-person ("Get Your")
- Urgency language vs value language

**Images**:
- People vs product shots
- Happy faces vs serious expressions
- Close-ups vs wide shots

### Performance Metrics to Track

**Engagement Metrics**:
- **Time on page** - Are people staying to read?
- **Scroll depth** - Do they scroll past the hero?
- **Click-through rate** - Are buttons being clicked?

**Conversion Metrics**:
- **Form submissions** from hero buttons
- **Product page visits** from hero links
- **Phone calls** if number is displayed

**Quality Metrics**:

- **Mobile usability** - Does it work well on phones?
