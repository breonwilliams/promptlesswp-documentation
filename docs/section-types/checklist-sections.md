# Checklist Sections

Checklist sections present information in a visually appealing list format with icons, perfect for comparing options, highlighting features, or showing what's included. They're ideal for pros and cons lists, feature comparisons, or any content that benefits from clear visual indicators.

## What Are Checklist Sections?

Checklist sections display items with visual indicators (checkmarks, X marks, or custom icons) to help visitors quickly scan and understand information. They're excellent for:
- **What's included vs. not included** in packages or plans
- **Pros and cons** comparisons
- **Feature lists** with visual confirmation
- **Benefits and limitations** clearly displayed
- **Requirements or prerequisites** for services

Think of checklist sections as your visual guide to help visitors quickly understand what they get (or don't get) with your offering.

### When to Use Checklist Sections

**Perfect for**:
- **Package comparisons** - What's included in each tier
- **Pros and cons lists** - Balanced view of options
- **Feature confirmations** - Visual "yes/no" indicators
- **Requirements lists** - What visitors need to get started
- **Benefit highlights** - Key advantages with checkmarks

**Best placement**: After introductory content, before pricing sections, or as supporting evidence for claims.
