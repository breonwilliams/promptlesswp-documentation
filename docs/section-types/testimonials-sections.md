# Testimonials Sections

Testimonials sections showcase what real customers say about your business. They provide powerful social proof that helps convince potential customers you're the right choice. This guide shows you how to create compelling testimonials sections that build trust and drive conversions.

## What Are Testimonials Sections?

Testimonials sections display customer reviews, feedback, and success stories in an attractive, trustworthy format. They help visitors understand:
- **Real experiences** from actual customers
- **Specific benefits** others have received
- **Social proof** that you deliver on promises
- **Credibility** through authentic voices

Think of testimonials as your customers doing the selling for you with their genuine experiences.

### When to Use Testimonials Sections

**Perfect for**:
- **Homepage trust building** - Show visitors others love your work
- **Service pages** - Prove specific services deliver results
- **Landing pages** - Convert hesitant visitors with social proof
- **About pages** - Demonstrate customer relationships and satisfaction
- **Product pages** - Show real-world usage and benefits

**Best placement**: After features or stats, before calls-to-action, as credibility before asking for action.
