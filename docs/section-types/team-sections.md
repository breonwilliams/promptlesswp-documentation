# Team Sections

Team sections introduce the people behind your business, helping visitors connect personally with your company. They build trust, showcase expertise, and make your business feel more human and approachable. This guide shows you how to create compelling team sections that strengthen relationships with your audience.

## What Are Team Sections?

Team sections display information about your team members, staff, or leadership in an organized, professional format. They help visitors:
- **Connect personally** with the people they'll work with
- **Understand expertise** and qualifications of your team
- **Build trust** through transparency and professionalism
- **Feel confident** about the people behind the business

Think of team sections as introducing your visitors to the real people who will serve them.

### When to Use Team Sections

**Perfect for**:
- **About pages** - Core team introductions and company culture
- **Service pages** - Show expertise relevant to specific services
- **Contact pages** - Put faces to names before visitors reach out
- **Leadership pages** - Highlight executive team and company direction
- **Department pages** - Introduce specific teams (sales, support, etc.)

**Best placement**: After company information but before testimonials or contact information.
