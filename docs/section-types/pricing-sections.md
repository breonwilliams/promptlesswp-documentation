# Pricing Sections

Pricing sections display your plans, packages, or pricing options in a clear, compelling format that helps visitors choose the right option and take action. They're crucial for converting visitors into customers. This guide shows you how to create effective pricing sections that drive sales.

## What Are Pricing Sections?

Pricing sections present your pricing plans, packages, or service options in an organized, comparison-friendly format. They help visitors:
- **Compare different options** quickly and easily
- **Understand what's included** in each plan or service
- **See clear value propositions** for different price points
- **Take action** with compelling calls-to-action

Think of pricing sections as your sales presentation - they should make the buying decision as easy as possible.

### When to Use Pricing Sections

**Perfect for**:
- **Pricing pages** - Main pricing presentation for your business
- **Service pages** - Show different service levels or packages
- **Product pages** - Display product variants or bundles
- **Landing pages** - Focused conversion for specific offerings
- **Subscription services** - Monthly/yearly plan comparisons

**Best placement**: After value has been established through features, benefits, and social proof.

## Pricing Section Elements

### Header Content

**Eyebrow Heading**
- **Purpose**: Context for the pricing information
- **Examples**: "Pricing Plans", "Choose Your Package", "Investment Options"
- **Keep brief**: 1-3 words maximum

**Main Heading**
- **Purpose**: Compelling title that frames value, not just cost
