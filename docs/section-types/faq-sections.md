# FAQ Sections

FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) sections help visitors find answers quickly and reduce barriers to purchasing. They address common concerns, explain processes, and provide helpful information in an organized, scannable format. This guide shows you how to create effective FAQ sections that convert more visitors.

## What Are FAQ Sections?

FAQ sections present questions and answers in an expandable format that helps visitors:
- **Find specific information** quickly and easily
- **Address concerns** before they become objections
- **Understand processes** and how things work
- **Build confidence** through transparency

Think of FAQ sections as your 24/7 customer service representative, answering the most common questions automatically.

### When to Use FAQ Sections

**Perfect for**:
- **Product pages** - Address features, compatibility, and usage questions
- **Service pages** - Explain processes, timelines, and what's included
- **Pricing pages** - Clarify billing, contracts, and value questions
- **Support pages** - Provide self-service help for common issues
- **Landing pages** - Remove barriers to conversion with preemptive answers

**Best placement**: Near the end of pages, after presenting value but before final call-to-action.
