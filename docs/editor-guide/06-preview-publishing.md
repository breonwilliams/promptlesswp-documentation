# Preview & Publishing

Before your page goes live, it's important to preview your work and understand how publishing works with Promptless WP. This guide covers everything about previewing, checking your work, and publishing pages.

## Understanding Preview vs Live

### Editor Preview
**What it is**: The live preview you see in the center panel of the editor
**Shows**: Real-time updates as you edit
**Purpose**: Immediate feedback while building
**Limitations**: May not show exact theme integration

### Page Preview  
**What it is**: Full page preview in a new browser tab
**Shows**: Exactly how visitors will see your page
**Purpose**: Final check before publishing
**Includes**: Your theme's header, footer, and navigation

### Live Site
**What it is**: Your actual published page on the internet
**Shows**: The final result visitors see
**Purpose**: The real deal - your published content
**Includes**: Full theme integration, SEO, and functionality

## Using the Preview System

### Opening Preview
1. **Click the "Preview" button** in the top toolbar (eye icon)
2. **New browser tab opens** showing your page
3. **Page displays** exactly as visitors will see it
4. **Keep both tabs open** for easy comparison

### What Preview Shows
The preview includes:
- **Your theme's header and footer**
- **Navigation menus**
- **Sidebar widgets** (if your theme has them)
- **All your sections** with final styling
- **Responsive design** for different screen sizes

### Auto-Refresh Feature
The preview page automatically updates when you:
- **Save changes** in the editor
- **Make global setting changes**
- **Update section content**
- **Change display modes**

## Cache and Performance Considerations

### Browser Cache
**What it is**: Your browser stores copies of images and files
**Why it matters**: You might not see changes immediately
**Solution**: 
- **Refresh with Ctrl+F5** (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- **Use private/incognito browsing** for testing
- **Clear browser cache** if changes don't appear

### Plugin Caching
**What it is**: Caching plugins store page copies for speed
**Why it matters**: Changes might not appear on live site immediately
**Solution**:
- **Clear cache** after publishing
- **Check with cache plugin** for clearing options
- **Wait a few minutes** for automatic cache updates

### CDN Caching
**What it is**: Content delivery networks cache your site globally
**Why it matters**: Changes may take longer to appear worldwide
**Solution**:
- **Clear CDN cache** if you have one
- **Wait for cache expiration** (usually 24 hours max)
- **Test from different locations** or use online tools

## Troubleshooting Preview Issues

### Preview Doesn't Match Editor
**Possible causes**:
- Display mode setting (Canvas vs Fullwidth)
- Theme conflicts with section styling
- Cache not cleared
- Changes not saved properly

**Solutions**:
1. **Check display mode** in WordPress page editor
2. **Clear all caches** and refresh
3. **Save changes** again in editor
4. **Contact support** if issues persist

### Preview Shows Errors
**Possible causes**:
- Missing required content in sections
- Invalid image or video URLs
- Theme compatibility issues
- JavaScript conflicts

**Solutions**:
1. **Check for orange/red** section indicators
2. **Fix missing content** or broken media
3. **Test with default theme** temporarily
4. **Disable other plugins** to test conflicts

### Mobile Preview Problems
**Possible causes**:
- Theme not responsive
- Custom CSS overrides
- Images too large
- Text too small

**Solutions**:
1. **Test with mobile device** (not just narrow browser)
2. **Check theme responsiveness**
3. **Optimize images** for mobile
4. **Adjust text sizes** in global settings
