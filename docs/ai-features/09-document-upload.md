# Document Upload

Transform your existing documents into beautiful web pages automatically! This guide shows you how to upload documents and prepare them for AI processing.

## Supported Document Types

### Microsoft Word Documents (.docx)
**Best supported format** - The AI works exceptionally well with Word documents because:
- **Structured content** - Headings, lists, and paragraphs are preserved
- **Formatting recognition** - Bold, italic, and other formatting carries over
- **Hierarchy understanding** - The AI recognizes heading levels and structure
- **Table support** - Data tables can become stats or pricing sections

### What's Not Supported (Yet)
- **.doc files** (older Word format) - Convert to .docx first
- **PDF files** - Copy text out and paste instead
- **PowerPoint files** - Copy content to Word document first
- **Excel files** - Copy data to Word document with formatting
- **Images within documents** - Text content only is processed

## Preparing Your Document

### Document Structure Best Practices

To get the best AI results, structure your document like this:

#### Use Clear Headings
```
# Main Page Title (Heading 1)
## Section Name (Heading 2) 
### Subsection (Heading 3)
```

**Why this helps**: AI uses headings to create different sections. Heading 2s become section titles, Heading 3s become feature cards or subsections.

#### Organize with Lists
```
Benefits of Our Service:
• Fast delivery
• Expert support  
• Affordable pricing
• 24/7 availability
```

**Why this helps**: Lists automatically become feature cards, stats, or bullet points in sections.

#### Include Specific Information
```
Our Results:
• 500+ happy customers
• 99% success rate
• 24-hour average response time
• Founded in 2018
```

**Why this helps**: Numbers and stats get highlighted in special stats sections.

#### Add Testimonials Clearly
```
Customer Feedback:

"This service exceeded our expectations. The team delivered exactly what we needed, on time and within budget." - Sarah Johnson, CEO

"Working with them was a pleasure. Great communication and fantastic results." - Mike Chen, Marketing Director
```

**Why this helps**: AI recognizes quotes with attribution and creates testimonial sections.

### Content Organization Tips

#### Group Related Content
Keep similar content together:
- **All benefits in one section**
- **All testimonials together**
- **Process steps in order**
- **Team information grouped**

#### Use Descriptive Headings
Instead of vague headings like "About", use specific ones:
- ✅ "Why Choose Our Marketing Services"
- ✅ "Our 3-Step Process"
- ✅ "What Our Customers Say"
- ❌ "About"
- ❌ "Info"
- ❌ "Section 1"

#### Include Complete Information
For best results, include:
- **Full descriptions** not just bullet points
- **Context** for numbers and stats
- **Complete testimonials** with names and roles
- **Clear calls-to-action** telling people what to do next

### File Size and Length Guidelines

#### Optimal Document Size
- **Length**: 1-10 pages work best
- **File size**: Under 5MB
- **Word count**: 500-5,000 words ideal
- **Sections**: 3-8 main sections per document

#### If Your Document Is Too Long
**Option 1**: Split into multiple documents
- Break at natural sections
- Each document becomes one webpage
- Upload and process separately

**Option 2**: Edit down to essentials
- Remove unnecessary content
- Focus on main messages
- Keep most important information

**Option 3**: Use key excerpts
- Copy important sections
- Paste into new document
- Focus on high-impact content
