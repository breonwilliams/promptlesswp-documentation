# AI Generation Process

This guide walks you through the complete process of generating sections with AI, from uploading your content to refining the final results.

## Complete AI Workflow Overview

The AI generation process has these steps:
1. **Upload/Paste Content** - Get your content into the system
2. **Configure AI Settings** - Choose tone and optimization preferences  
3. **Generate Sections** - Let AI create structured sections
4. **Review Results** - Check quality and accuracy
5. **Select Sections** - Choose which sections to add
6. **Refine and Edit** - Customize the generated content
7. **Publish** - Make your page live

Let's walk through each step in detail.

## Step 1: Opening the AI Assistant

### Access the AI Modal
1. **Open the Promptless WP editor** for your page
2. **Click "Generate with AI"** button in the top toolbar (sparkle/magic icon)
3. **AI modal opens** showing upload options

### Check AI Status
The modal first checks if AI is properly configured:

## Step 4: Generate Your Sections

### Start the Generation Process
1. **Click "Generate Sections"** button
2. **AI processing begins** - this takes 30-60 seconds
3. **Progress indicators** show current step:
   - "Analyzing your content..."
   - "Identifying section types..."
   - "Generating content..."
   - "Optimizing design..."

### What Happens During Generation
The AI performs these tasks:
- **Content analysis** - Understanding structure and meaning
- **Section mapping** - Deciding which content becomes which sections
- **Content optimization** - Improving headlines and descriptions
- **Design selection** - Choosing layouts and styling
- **Quality scoring** - Rating the results

### Generation Time
Typical processing times:
- **Small documents** (1-2 pages) - 30-45 seconds
- **Medium documents** (3-5 pages) - 45-90 seconds  
- **Large documents** (6+ pages) - 90-180 seconds

If generation takes longer than 3 minutes, there may be an issue - check the troubleshooting guide.

## Step 5: Review Generated Results

### Understanding the Results Panel
After generation completes, you'll see:
- **Generated sections list** - All sections the AI created
- **Quality scores** - AI's confidence in each section
- **Preview area** - How each section will look
- **Selection checkboxes** - Choose which sections to add

### Section Quality Scores

**90-100% (Excellent)**
- High-quality content with minimal editing needed
- Well-structured and complete
- Ready to use with minor customization

**80-89% (Good)**  
- Solid content that may need some refinement
- Good structure with room for improvement
- Worth including with some editing

**70-79% (Fair)**
- Decent content but needs careful review
- May have generic or incomplete information
- Consider editing significantly or regenerating

**Below 70% (Poor)**
- Low confidence in content quality
- Likely needs major editing or complete rewrite
- May be better to create manually

### Reviewing Each Section
Click on each section to review:
- **Content accuracy** - Is the information correct?
- **Relevance** - Does it fit your needs?
- **Completeness** - Is important information missing?
- **Tone** - Does it match your brand voice?

## Step 6: Select and Customize Sections

### Selecting Sections to Add
- **Checkboxes** next to each section control selection
- **All sections selected** by default
- **Uncheck sections** you don't want to add
- **Quality scores help** decide what to include

### Selection Strategies
**Include High-Quality Sections** (80%+ scores)
- These need minimal editing
- Good foundation to build on
- Save significant time

**Review Medium-Quality Sections** (70-79% scores)
- May be worth including with editing
- Check if content fills important gaps
- Consider if easier than building manually

**Skip Low-Quality Sections** (Below 70%)
- Usually better to build manually
- May have inaccurate or generic content
- Not worth the editing time

### Design Strategy Application
Before adding sections, choose design strategy:
- **Balanced** - Alternates light/dark sections automatically
- **Consistent Light** - All sections use light theme
- **Consistent Dark** - All sections use dark theme

This affects how sections will look when added to your page.

## Step 7: Add Sections to Your Page

### Import Process
1. **Review your selections** one final time
2. **Click "Add Selected Sections"** button
3. **Modal closes** and sections are added to your page
4. **Sections appear** in the editor preview
5. **Left sidebar shows** the section list with all new sections

### What Happens When Sections Are Added
- **Sections insert** at the end of your existing content
- **Content populates** automatically from AI generation
- **Design settings apply** based on your strategy choice
- **Images remain empty** - you'll need to add these manually
- **Buttons populate** with generated text and placeholder links

### Initial Review
After sections are added:
- **Scroll through the preview** to see all sections
- **Check section order** - drag and drop to rearrange if needed
- **Look for obvious errors** - missing content, strange formatting
- **Verify text makes sense** - AI isn't perfect

## Step 8: Refining Your Generated Content

### Editing Section Content
Click on any generated section to edit:

**Common Refinements Needed**:
- **Add relevant images** - AI doesn't generate images
- **Update button links** - Point to actual pages on your site
- **Personalize content** - Add your specific details
- **Fix any inaccuracies** - AI sometimes gets details wrong
- **Adjust tone** - Make it sound more like your brand

### Content That Usually Needs Editing

**Generic Placeholders**:
- Company names might be generic
- Contact information needs updating
- Specific numbers may be placeholder values
- Testimonials might need real customer details

**Button Links**:
- URLs are often placeholder (/contact, /about)
- Button text might be generic ("Learn More")
- Update with your actual page URLs

**Images**:
- All sections will need relevant images
- Consider your brand guidelines for image style
- Ensure images support the content message

### Quality Improvement Tips

**Enhance Headlines**:
- Make them more specific to your business
- Include your unique value proposition
- Use action words that motivate visitors

**Improve Descriptions**:
- Add specific benefits and features
- Include social proof (numbers, customer names)
- Make content more concrete and less generic

**Optimize Calls-to-Action**:
- Use compelling action words
- Create urgency or value
- Link to appropriate pages
