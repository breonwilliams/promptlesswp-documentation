Install and configure Promptless WP to start building pages with AI-powered content generation.

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.0 or newer
- PHP 7.4 or newer
- OpenAI API key (optional - only for AI features)

## Step 1: Install the Plugin

### Method 1: Upload via WordPress Admin
1. Download the Promptless WP plugin (.zip)
2. Go to Plugins → Add New in WordPress admin
3. Click "Upload Plugin"
4. Choose the downloaded file
5. Click "Install Now" then "Activate"

### Method 2: FTP Upload
1. Extract the plugin zip file
2. Upload `promptless-wp` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
3. Go to Plugins in WordPress admin
4. Find "Promptless WP" and click "Activate"

## Step 2: Choose Your Plan

On first activation, Freemius will present licensing options:

### Free Version (2 Pages)
- Click "Skip" to use free version
- Create up to 2 pages with unlimited sections per page
- Upgrade anytime for more pages

### Premium Version (Unlimited)
- Click "Activate License" if you have a key
- Enter license key from purchase email
- Unlocks unlimited page creation

## Step 3: Verify Installation

The plugin requires:
- WordPress 6.0+
- PHP 7.4+
- 128MB memory minimum
- Standard file write permissions

If requirements aren't met, contact your hosting provider.

## Step 4: Access the Plugin

"Promptless WP" appears in your WordPress admin menu.

Available admin pages:
- AI Settings - Configure OpenAI integration
- Cache Management - Clear plugin cache
- Data Management - Backup and data options
- Reusable Elements - Manage text snippets

## Step 5: Configure AI (Optional)

To enable AI document processing:

1. Get an OpenAI API key from openai.com
2. Go to Promptless WP → AI Settings
3. Enter your API key
4. Click "Test Connection"
5. Save settings

AI features are optional. The plugin works without an API key - you'll manually create content instead of using AI generation.

## Step 6: Start Building

1. Go to Pages → Add New
2. Enter a page title
3. Find "Promptless WP" meta box below content
4. Click "Activate Promptless WP"
5. Click "Edit with Promptless WP"

This opens the visual page builder where you'll add sections and content.
