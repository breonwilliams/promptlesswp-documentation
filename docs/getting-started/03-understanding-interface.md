## Common Interface Questions

### "Why did the left sidebar change?"
The left sidebar adapts to what you're doing - it shows content editing when a section is selected, and section management when nothing is selected.

### "How do I know which section I'm editing?"
Look for the blue outline in the preview and the highlighted section in the left sidebar section list.

### "Can I hide the sidebars?"
Yes! Click the eye icon in the toolbar to toggle sidebars on/off for more preview space.

### "Where are my changes saved?"
Changes to content save automatically to the page. Global design settings need to be saved manually using the "Save Settings" button.

## Tips

- Use section list for quick navigation
- Hide sidebars for more preview space  
- Save frequently
