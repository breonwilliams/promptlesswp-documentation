### Font Pairing Principles

**Contrast**: Choose fonts that are different enough to create hierarchy

- Display heading + Simple body font
- Bold heading font + Light body font

**Harmony**: Choose fonts that share similar characteristics
- Both fonts have similar letter widths
- Both fonts have similar character personalities
- Both fonts work well at their intended sizes

**Simplicity**: Avoid using too many different fonts
- Maximum 2-3 font families per website
- Use weight and size variations instead of new fonts
- Keep it simple for better performance and consistency

## Typography Hierarchy and Sizing

### Understanding Text Sizes

AI Section Builder uses a systematic approach to text sizing:

**Section Headings** (Largest):
- Main titles for each content section
- Should be immediately noticeable
- Creates clear content organization

**Card/Item Headings** (Medium-Large):
- Titles within feature cards, testimonials, team members
- Smaller than section headings but larger than body text
- Creates hierarchy within content blocks

**Body Text** (Medium):
- Paragraph content, descriptions, explanations
- Optimized for comfortable reading
- The most common text size on your site

**Muted/Secondary Text** (Smaller):
- Captions, metadata, dates, less important information
- Uses same size as body text but muted color
- Provides information without visual competition

### Responsive Typography

Your fonts automatically adapt to different screen sizes:

**Desktop**: Full-size typography with maximum impact
**Tablet**: Slightly smaller but still prominent
**Mobile**: Optimized for small screens while maintaining readability

**Why this matters**:
- Ensures readability on all devices
- Maintains visual hierarchy across screen sizes
- Improves user experience on mobile devices
- Reduces the need for manual adjustments

## Font Loading and Performance

### Web Fonts vs System Fonts

**Web Fonts** (Google Fonts, Adobe Fonts):
- **Pros**: More design choices, consistent across devices, brand personality
- **Cons**: Slower loading, dependent on external services
- **Best for**: When brand identity is important

**System Fonts** (Arial, Times, Helvetica):
- **Pros**: Instant loading, no external dependencies, universal availability  
- **Cons**: Limited choices, less unique branding
- **Best for**: Speed-critical sites, simple designs

### Optimizing Font Performance

**Choose wisely**:
- Select only the font weights you actually need
- Avoid using too many different font families
- Consider font file sizes in your choices

**Loading optimization**:
- Fonts are preloaded for faster display
- System provides fallbacks while web fonts load
- Critical text appears immediately with system fonts
