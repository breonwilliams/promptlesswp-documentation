# Colors & Branding

Your colors are the visual foundation of your website's identity. AI Section Builder provides powerful color and branding tools that ensure consistency across all your content while maintaining professional accessibility standards. This guide shows you how to create a cohesive brand experience.

## Understanding the Color System

### Primary Brand Colors

Your **primary color** is the main color that represents your brand. It's used for:
- **Call-to-action buttons** - Your most important buttons
- **Interactive elements** - Links, form highlights, active states
- **Brand accents** - Strategic highlights throughout your content

**Choose a color that**:
- Represents your brand personality
- Works well across different contexts
- Has good contrast for accessibility
- Complements your industry expectations

### Text Colors

**Main Text Color**
- Used for all body content, descriptions, and paragraphs
- Should provide excellent readability on your background
- Typically a dark color for light backgrounds

**Muted Text Color**
- Used for secondary information like captions, metadata, dates
- Slightly lighter than main text for visual hierarchy
- Still maintains good readability while being less prominent

### Background Colors

**Main Background**
- The primary background color for your website sections
- Usually white, light gray, or another neutral color
- Creates the canvas for all your content

**Surface Color**
- Used for cards, panels, and elevated content areas
- Slightly different from main background to create depth
- Often white on light themes, or a lighter shade

**Border Color**
- Defines edges and separations between content areas
- Subtle color that adds structure without being distracting
- Usually a light gray or neutral tone

## Working with Dark Mode

### Automatic Dark Mode Colors

AI Section Builder automatically manages dark mode versions of your colors:

**When you set light mode colors, the system creates**:
- **Dark background** - Appropriate dark version of your background
- **Dark surface** - Elevated areas in dark theme
- **Dark text** - Light text colors that work on dark backgrounds
- **Dark muted text** - Secondary text for dark backgrounds
- **Dark borders** - Subtle borders for dark theme structure

**You can customize these** if the automatic versions don't match your brand.

### Dark Mode Best Practices

**Contrast Considerations**:
- Dark themes need lighter text colors for readability
- Borders should be more subtle in dark mode
- Primary colors may need adjustment for dark backgrounds

**Brand Consistency**:
- Your primary brand color should work in both light and dark themes
- Test all combinations to ensure your brand remains recognizable
- Consider how your logo and imagery work with dark backgrounds

## Smart Accessibility Colors

### What They Do

Smart Accessibility Colors is an intelligent system that automatically adjusts colors for optimal readability and accessibility compliance.

**When enabled, the system**:
- **Analyzes contrast ratios** between text and background colors
- **Automatically adjusts colors** that don't meet accessibility standards
- **Maintains your brand identity** while ensuring readability
- **Works across all sections** and content types

### How They Work

**Intelligent Color Calculations**:
```
Your original color + Background context = Optimized accessible color
```

**Example**: If your primary blue doesn't have enough contrast on a light background, the system automatically darkens it just enough to meet accessibility standards while keeping it recognizably blue.

**Benefits**:
- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** automatically maintained
- **No manual color testing** required
- **Consistent accessibility** across all content
- **Brand colors preserved** as much as possible

### When to Enable Smart Colors

**Recommended for**:
- **Government or institutional websites** requiring accessibility compliance
- **E-commerce sites** serving diverse audiences
- **Educational platforms** needing inclusive design
- **Any public-facing website** wanting to ensure accessibility

**Consider carefully for**:
- **Highly specific brand guidelines** that can't be adjusted
- **Creative projects** where exact colors are critical
- **Brand-sensitive industries** where color precision is essential

## Setting Up Your Brand Colors

### Step 1: Choose Your Primary Color

**Consider your brand personality**:
- **Tech/Modern**: Blues, greens, purples
- **Creative/Artistic**: Bright colors, unique combinations
- **Professional/Corporate**: Deep blues, grays, subdued tones
- **Health/Wellness**: Greens, soft blues, earth tones
- **Finance/Legal**: Deep blues, grays, conservative choices

**Test your primary color**:
- Does it work for buttons on both light and dark backgrounds?
- Is it distinctive enough to stand out?
- Does it represent your brand appropriately?

### Step 2: Set Text Colors

**Main text color guidelines**:
- **Dark gray** rather than pure black for better readability
- **High contrast** with your background color
- **Consistent with your brand tone** (warmer or cooler grays)

**Muted text guidelines**:
- **Lighter than main text** but still readable
- **Used for less important information**
- **Maintains hierarchy** without being too faint

### Step 3: Configure Backgrounds

**Background color strategy**:
- **Light backgrounds** work well for most content
- **Neutral colors** provide good base for varied content
- **Consider your imagery** - does your background complement photos/graphics?

**Surface color approach**:
- **Slightly different** from main background
- **Creates depth** for cards and panels
- **Usually white** on light themes for maximum contrast

### Step 4: Test and Refine

**Testing checklist**:
- [ ] **Check readability** of all text combinations
- [ ] **Test on mobile devices** for small screen visibility
- [ ] **Review with actual content** including images and videos
- [ ] **Verify accessibility** with contrast checking tools
- [ ] **Test dark mode** if you plan to use it
